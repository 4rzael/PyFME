Welcome to PyFME's documentation!
=================================

PyFME :rocket: :airplane: stands for Python Flight Mechanics Engine.

The main idea behind a Flight Dynamics Engine is to model the physics involved in aircraft's flight. Models for the
aircraft, atmosphere, dynamics, aerodynamics... implemented here allow us to calculate the aircraft response to the
pilot's inputs.
